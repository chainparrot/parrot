Also, the recipient needs to be synced up with the block chain before it'll see the received transaction. That means the status bar at the bottom needs to say at least 33000 blocks, like \"x connections 33200 blocks x transactions\".Quote from: sirius-m on January 05, 2010, 01:20:06 AMQuoteHowever, once that transaction was complete, a new transaction hasn't started. Or maybe it has. There's only one transaction in the list but I'm up to 131 Blocks under \"Status\". Is this the way it's supposed to happen? Does it keep processing on the same transaction and generating coins every 120 blocks or so? Or is it supposed to start a new transaction?The number of blocks of a transaction is the amount of new blocks that have been generated by the whole network after the transaction. Each new block in the chain means new coins to its creator. One \"generated\" -transaction in your transaction list means that you have generated one block. You're not the first one to find the concept of a \"block\" a bit confusing on the first sight.Would it be clearer if the status said \"x confirmations\", like:2/unconfirmed3/unconfirmed4/unconfirmed5/unconfirmed6 confirmations7 confirmations8 confirmationsEach block essentially means another node has confirmed that it agrees with all transactions up to that point.",

Any time you transfer money out of it, then you must no longer use any previous copies.This brings up a good point. In the case of restoring a backup that may be from before you spent some coins, we need to add functionality to resync it to discover which coins have already been spent.

I thought it would be impractical if the block chain, bitcoin addresses, disk space and bandwidth requirements were all an order of magnitude bigger. Also, even if using RSA for messages, it would still make sense to do all the bitcoin network with ECDSA and use RSA in parallel for only the message part. In that case, everything that's been implemented up to now would be implemented exactly as it has been.We can figure out the best way to do this much later. It could use a separate (maybe existing) e-mail or IM infrastructure to pass messages, and instead of RSA, maybe just put a hash of the message in the transaction to prove that the transaction is for the order described in the message. The message would have to include a salt so nobody could brute force the hash to reveal a short message.",

You should not use Polipo or Privoxy as those are http filters and caches that would corrupt Bitcoin's messages if they make any changes. Bitcoin might be trying to overcome it by reconnecting. You should use port 9050.As riX says, the \"is giving Tor only an IP address. Apps that do DNS...\" warnings are nothing to worry about. Bitcoin doesn't use DNS at all in proxy mode.Since Bitcoin can't get through to IRC through Tor, it doesn't know which nodes are currently online, so it has to try all the recently seen nodes. It tries to conserve connection attempts as much as possible, but also people want it to connect quickly when they start it up and reconnect quickly if disconnected. It uses an algorithm where it tries an IP less and less frequently the longer ago it was successful connected. For example, for a node it saw 24 hours ago, it would wait 5 hours between connection attempts. Once it has at least 2 connections, it won't try anything over a week old, and 5 connections it won't try anything over 24 hours old.",

That means you generate only 55% as many coins for the same amount of work.The difficulty adjusts proportionally to the total effort across the network. If the number of nodes doubles, the difficulty will also double, returning the total generated to the target rate.For those technically inclined, the proof-of-work difficulty can be seen by searching on \"target:\" in debug.log. It's a 256-bit unsigned hex number, which the SHA-256 value has to be less than to successfully generate a block. It gets adjusted every 2016 blocks, typically two weeks. That's when it prints \"GetNextWorkRequired RETARGET\" in debug.log. minimum  00000000ffff000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000030/12/2009 00000000d86a000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011/01/2010 00000000c428000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000025/01/2010 00000000be71000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004/02/2010 000000008cc3000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000014/02/2010 000000006546570000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000024/02/2010 0000000043b3e50000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000008/03/2010 00000000387f6f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000021/03/2010 000000003813750000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000001/04/2010 000000002a11150000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000012/04/2010 0000000020bca70000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000021/04/2010 0000000016546f0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000004/05/2010 0000000013ec530000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000019/05/2010 00000000159c240000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000029/05/2010 000000000f675c0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000011/06/2010 000000000eba640000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000024/06/2010 000000000d31420000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000006/07/2010 000000000ae4930000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000013/07/2010 0000000005a3f40000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000016/07/2010 000000000168fd0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000027/07/2010 00000000010c5a0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000005/08/2010 0000000000ba180000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000015/08/2010 0000000000800e0000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000026/08/2010 0000000000692000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000000date, difficulty factor, % change2009      1.0030/12/2009   1.18  +18%11/01/2010   1.31  +11%25/01/2010   1.34  +2%04/02/2010   1.82  +36%14/02/2010   2.53  +39%24/02/2010   3.78  +49%08/03/2010   4.53  +20%21/03/2010   4.57  +9%01/04/2010   6.09  +33%12/04/2010   7.82  +28%21/04/2010  11.46  +47%04/05/2010  12.85  +12%19/05/2010  11.85  -8%29/05/2010  16.62  +40%11/06/2010  17.38  +5%24/06/2010  19.41  +12%06/07/2010  23.50  +21%13/07/2010  45.38  +93%16/07/2010  181.54 +300%27/07/2010  244.21  +35%05/08/2010  352.17  +44%15/08/2010  511.77  +45%26/08/2010 623.39 +22%",

Once the software support is implemented, anyone could contribute translations.wxWidgets uses the gettext standard. You use the gettext tools or something like poedit to create a .po file by scanning the sourcefiles for strings and editing the translations into the .po file, then compile it into a .mo file. The program loads the .mo file at runtime and reskins all the strings. Additional languages can be added to an existing program by adding .mo files without recompiling the program.On Windows, the .mo files would go in a lang subdirectory in the directory where the EXE is located.Right now I'm working on JSON-RPC and command line support, but when I'm finished with that I hope to do this next.",

A transaction is over the maximum size limit if it has to add up more than 500 of the largest payments you've received to make up the amount. A transaction over the size limit can still be sent if a small fee is added.The average transaction, and anything up to 500 times bigger than average, is free.It's only when you're sending a really huge transaction that the transaction fee ever comes into play, and even then it only works out to something like 0.002% of the amount.

This saves bandwidth, although it doesn't use much bandwidth to begin with, so it wouldn't really matter unless you had tons of computers.For redundancy in case the first computer goes down, you could have two that connect out and the rest connect to both of them. The first two are run normally, the rest are run like:bitcoin -connect=<IP1> -connect=<IP2>",

With older PCs it will take forever. People like to feel that they \"own\" something as soon as possible, is there a way to make the generation more divisible? So say, instead of making \u0e3f50 every 20 hours, make \u0e3f5 every 2 hours? I thought about that but there wasn't a practical way to do smaller increments. The frequency of block generation is balanced between confirming transactions as fast as possible and the latency of the network.The algorithm aims for an average of 6 blocks per hour. If it was 5 bc and 60 per hour, there would be 10 times as many blocks and the initial block download would take 10 times as long. It wouldn't work anyway because that would be only 1 minute average between blocks, too close to the broadcast latency when the network gets larger.",

The protocol is designed to resync to the next message, and messages get re-requested from all the other nodes you're connected to until received. If you miss a block, it'll also keep requesting it every time another blocks comes in and it sees there's a gap.

In your head, you do a probability estimate balancing the odds that it keeps increasing.In the absence of a market to establish the price, NewLibertyStandard's estimate based on production cost is a good guess and a helpful service (thanks). The price of any commodity tends to gravitate toward the production cost. If the price is below cost, then production slows down. If the price is above cost, profit can be made by generating and selling more. At the same time, the increased production would increase the difficulty, pushing the cost of generating towards the price.In later years, when new coin generation is a small percentage of the existing supply, market price will dictate the cost of production more than the other way around.At the moment, generation effort is rapidly increasing, suggesting people are estimating the present value to be higher than the current cost of production.",

Version 0.2.7 on SVN.I split out the init and shutdown stuff from ui.cpp into init.cpp, so now ui.cpp is pure UI. ui.h provides inline stubs if wxUSE_GUI=0. We only have four functions that interface from the node to the UI. In the bitcoind build, we don't link ui.o or uibase.o.Quote from: sirius-m on February 25, 2010, 04:32:17 PMIt started increasing right away. I'll see if valgrind can help me.Sure feels like it could be something in wxWidgets retrying endlessly because some UI thing failed or something wasn't inited correctly. Our hack to ignore the initialize failure and run anyway means we're in uncharted territory. We're relying on the fact that we hardly use wx in this mode. We do still use a few things like wxGetTranslation and wxMutex.Another way to debug would be to run in gdb, wait until everything is quiet and all threads should be idle, and break it and see which thread is busily doing something and what it's doing.I suspect bitcoind will probably work fine, but I hope you can still debug the problem.",

The UTF-16 version is the \"unicode\" version provided in the Debian package. I believe 2.8 and its UTF-16 build labelled simply \"unicode\" has been the source of build problems described in the forum. We were previously using 2.8 ANSI in anticipation of getting to UTF-8 without going through UTF-16 hell. We cannot compile with UTF-16.2.9 has only one version, UTF-8. On Windows, we set the codepage to UTF-8, so on all platforms our code is UTF-8 and wxWidgets interfaces with us in UTF-8. On Linux I assume the codepage is already UTF-8. By standardizing on 2.9 we avoid the multi-build confusion of 2.8, and we need 2.9 for UTF-8 internationalization.Make sure you read build-unix.txt and configure wxWidgets using the configure parameters given.Curious, why is it incredibly hard to provide wxWidgets 2.9.0? If you mean for users, that's why we static link it.It's unfortunate that we require so many big dependencies, but we need them all. At least on Debian/Ubuntu, all but wxWidgets are available as packages. Eventually they'll provide a 2.9 package.",

The seller puts the bitcoin payment in escrow, and the buyer sends the conventional payment directly to the seller.

If we get too big, then by the same token, we're big enough that we don't need IRC anymore and we'll get off.We only needed IRC because nobody had a static IP. In the early days there were some steady supporters, but they all had pool-allocated IPs that change every few days. IRC was only intended as a temporary solution. Bitcoin's built-in addr system is the main solution.Bitcoin can get the list of IPs from any bitcoin node. In that sense, every node serves as a directory server.When there are enough static IP nodes to have a good chance that at least one will still be running by the time the current version goes out of use, we can preprogram a seed list.How do you think we should compile the seed list? Would it be OK to create it from the currently connected IPs that have been static for a while?BTW, if we want to supplement by deploying separate directory server software, may I suggest IRC? IRC is a good directory server (I've heard it has other uses too), and there are mature IRC server implementations available that anyone can run.

They need the limits to keep it reasonable as a free service, but if we bolt on a Bitcoin payment mechanism, the limits could be relaxed.It doesn't have a bunch of client side scripting or anti-embedding junk to rip out. It generates standard links that work normally.There's a turnover churn in these free hosting sites. Small sites can give free image hosting, but once one starts getting popular, it gets too swamped with moochers using them for free bandwidth. Any site that gets well known has to become more aggressively pay-naggy to cover bandwidth costs. It's a perfect example of a service where the needed price point is in the no-man's-land between just a little too expensive to be free, but too cheap for most users to take the trouble of a conventional payment. It's in the gap between 0 and 19.95. The best they can do is try to maybe get 1 out of 1000 users to pay 9.95, but that has 999/1000 users treated like freeloaders. It can't really be advertising supported because the images are embedded in other sites and downloaded without going to the hosting site.An example of a site running the software:http://www.imagez.ws/Forum:http://www.mihalism.net/Download:http://code.google.com/p/mihalismmh/What do you think? If I made a Bitcoin payment integration for this, would anyone be interested in running it? It might be the first fully automated service available to buy with Bitcoins. The advantage it could offer over the free services is general file upload hosting of large files without making downloading users go to the upload site and jump through hoops. It would give a normal link directly to the file.",

Does it slow down half way through or is about the same speed the whole way?I've thought about ways to do a more cursory check of most of the chain up to the last few thousand blocks. It is possible, but it's a lot of work, and there are a lot of other higher priority things to work on.Simplified Payment Verification is for lightweight client-only users who only do transactions and don't generate and don't participate in the node network. They wouldn't need to download blocks, just the hash chain, which is currently about 2MB and very quick to verify (less than a second to verify the whole chain). If the network becomes very large, like over 100,000 nodes, this is what we'll use to allow common users to do transactions without being full blown nodes. At that stage, most users should start running client-only software and only the specialist server farms keep running full network nodes, kind of like how the usenet network has consolidated.SPV is not implemented yet, and won't be implemented until far in the future, but all the current implementation is designed around supporting it.In the meantime, sites like vekja.net and www.mybitcoin.com have been experimenting with account-based sites. You create an account on a website and hold your bitcoins on account there and transfer in and out. Creating an account on a website is a lot easier than installing and learning to use software, and a more familiar way of doing it for most people. The only disadvantage is that you have to trust the site, but that's fine for pocket change amounts for micropayments and misc expenses. It's an easy way to get started and if you get larger amounts then you can upgrade to the actual bitcoin software.",

New or renamed functions are:getreceivedbyaddress -- amount received on a single addressgetreceivedbylabel -- amount received by all addresses with this labellistreceivedbyaddress -- list addresses and amounts they've receivedlistreceivedbylabel -- list labels and amounts they've receivedsetlabel -- misc label functions for completenessgetlabelgetaddressesbylabelFor consistency I renamed getamountreceived->getreceivedbyaddress and getallreceived->listreceivedbyaddress. The old names are still there so as not to break existing code, but they're deprecated.The idea is that if you give the username whenever you call getnewaddress, you can get the user's total received across all their addresses using the \"bylabel\" functions. You can freely change their address without worrying about tracking all their old addresses.A good way to automate changing the user's receiving address: just before displaying their current address, check if it has been used to receive anything, if it has then replace it with a new one:// Get a new address whenever the current one has received anythingif (strAddr == \"\" || getreceivedbyaddress(strAddr) > 0) strAddr = getnewaddress(strUsername); // Label the address with usernameDisplay(strAddr); // Display their current receiving address// Get total received by all the user's addressesgetreceivedbylabel(strUsername, 0) // unconfirmedgetreceivedbylabel(strUsername, 1) // available balanceIf you're just getting one particular user's balance, such as in response to a page request by that user, use getreceivedbylabel, but if you're scanning over all users, it's better to use listreceivedbylabel to get the complete list and scan against the result. Scanning users with getreceivedbylabel would be n-squared, using listreceivedbylabel is n-log-n (or n linear).You should only really need to scan all users if you're polling in order to spontaneously take action in response to money received, rather than the user going to a webpage, seeing their balance and telling you what to do with it. It's not necessary to poll very frequently. If you require 1 confirmation, that'll take an average of 10 minutes anyway, so there's no point in polling more often than every few minutes.If you're selling digital goods and services, where you don't lose much if someone gets a free access, and it can't be resold for profit, I think you're fine to accept 0 confirmations.It's mostly only if you were selling gold or currency that you'd need multiple confirmations.",

Something that's allowed in url parameters would be nice.I want to use SSL for the connection, using the bitcoin address' public key as the cert. You would be certain you're connected to who you thought, and safely encrypted. The bitcoin address would not be used for the transaction, only for authentication. A new generated bitcoin address would be sent through the SSL connection.Since it's authenticated, it would then be safe to allow the IP address to be a domain name.

I can add code so new nodes do not preferentially stay connected to the seed nodes, just connect and get the list, so it won't be a burden on them.What do you think, should I go ahead with adding the seeds?It'll still try IRC first. The IRC has the advantage that it lists nodes that are currently online, since they have to stay connected to stay on the list, but the disadvantage that it's a single point of failure. The \"addr\" system has no single point of failure, but can only tell you what nodes have recently been seen, so it takes a little longer to get connected since some of the nodes you try have gone offline. The combination of the two gets us the best of both worlds and more total robustness.Is there anyone who wants to volunteer to run an IRC server in case freenode gets tired of us?",

        "post_content": "SirArthur has a good point about the normal online merchant case, which is what the send-by-IP option is more suited to. This is the case where the merchant will have a server on a static IP and their own domain name and SSL cert.Instead of connecting by IP, we can connect to a domain name by SSL, using the existing CA infrastructure to authenticate that you're connected to the owner of that domain.The user would send to domain.com (or www.domain.com is ok too). That would be very natural and users could see and verify that what they entered is who they intend to pay.The SSL also makes it safe for TOR users.Problem is, I think merchants would still prefer to use bitcoin addresses to be certain they know what the payment is for. You simply cannot count on users to enter the right thing in the comment fields to identify the transaction. It would only approach practical if we had a mailto style link that prepopulates the comment field with the order number, but then the link could just as well be a bitcoin address. Just having an open bitcoin server at domain.com that users could send unidentified payments to would be too much of a liability. Regular users aren't used to the idea of having to identify the payment. Merchants would get too many blank payments followed by \"I paid you, where's my stuff?!\" a week later.The payment sequence does have a step where the receiver verifies the order before accepting it. It can reject the payment and return an error message if it doesn't contain a valid order number. That would require a difficult level of integration of custom code with the bitcoin server though.",

Adding more transactions to the block you're working on does NOT slow down your generation rate. When generate is scanning hashes, it only hashes the header of the block, which is constant size. The header contains a hash of the transactions (the Merkle root) and is only updated occasionally.If necessary I can write code to make nodes prefer not to use a block if it doesn't contain enough of the transactions they know about. A discouraged block would almost always fail to be included in the main chain, but would be accepted if it did get in. I doubt this will be necessary, since there's no real advantage for nodes not to include all transactions.",

        "post_content": "The nature of Bitcoin is such that once version 0.1 was released, the core design was set in stone for the rest of its lifetime. Because of that, I wanted to design it to support every possible transaction type I could think of. The problem was, each thing required special support code and data fields whether it was used or not, and only covered one special case at a time. It would have been an explosion of special cases. The solution was script, which generalizes the problem so transacting parties can describe their transaction as a predicate that the node network evaluates. The nodes only need to understand the transaction to the extent of evaluating whether the sender's conditions are met.The script is actually a predicate. It's just an equation that evaluates to true or false. Predicate is a long and unfamiliar word so I called it script.The receiver of a payment does a template match on the script. Currently, receivers only accept two templates: direct payment and bitcoin address. Future versions can add templates for more transaction types and nodes running that version or higher will be able to receive them. All versions of nodes in the network can verify and process any new transactions into blocks, even though they may not know how to read them.The design supports a tremendous variety of possible transaction types that I designed years ago. Escrow transactions, bonded contracts, third party arbitration, multi-party signature, etc. If Bitcoin catches on in a big way, these are things we'll want to explore in the future, but they all had to be designed at the beginning to make sure they would be possible later.I don't believe a second, compatible implementation of Bitcoin will ever be a good idea. So much of the design depends on all nodes getting exactly identical results in lockstep that a second implementation would be a menace to the network. The MIT license is compatible with all other licenses and commercial uses, so there is no need to rewrite it from a licensing standpoint.",

It's hard enough maintaining backward compatibility while upgrading the network without a second version locking things in. If the second version screwed up, the user experience would reflect badly on both, although it would at least reinforce to users the importance of staying with the official version. If someone was getting ready to fork a second version, I would have to air a lot of disclaimers about the risks of using a minority version. This is a design where the majority version wins if there's any disagreement, and that can be pretty ugly for the minority version and I'd rather not go into it, and I don't have to as long as there's only one version.I know, most developers don't like their software forked, but I have real technical reasons in this case.Quote from: gavinandresen on June 17, 2010, 07:58:14 PMI admire the flexibility of the scripts-in-a-transaction scheme, but my evil little mind immediately starts to think of ways I might abuse it. I could encode all sorts of interesting information in the TxOut script, and if non-hacked clients validated-and-then-ignored those transactions it would be a useful covert broadcast communication channel.That's a cool feature until it gets popular and somebody decides it would be fun to flood the payment network with millions of transactions to transfer the latest Lady Gaga video to all their friends...That's one of the reasons for transaction fees. There are other things we can do if necessary.Quote from: laszlo on June 17, 2010, 06:50:31 PMHow long have you been working on this design Satoshi?

Everyone has the obvious questions looking for holes in it but it is holding up well Since 2007. At some point I became convinced there was a way to do this without any trust required at all and couldn't resist to keep thinking about it.

The .dat files are fine, their format shouldn't ever change. All data is stored in the .dat files. All your own data is stored in wallet.dat. If you had waited for it to redownload the block chain, your missing transactions and generateds would have appeared as the block chain reached the point where those transactions were recorded.When you copied the directory except log.0000000002, that's the best solution. You should be good now.The database/log.* files only contain temporary database data. If you exited bitcoin normally the last time, not exited by forced terminating it or crashing, then the database/log.* files can normally be deleted safely. They're only used so that if the database is in the middle of a transaction when the computer crashes or the program is killed or crashes, then it could recover without losing data.Please keep running v0.3 if at all possible, don't go back to v0.2.10.Anyone else who hits this problem, move the database\\log.000000000* files somewhere else. (if it works fine after that, you can delete them later)I'm reluctant to make the installer delete or move those files.

It could always be an Android app instead. An app is not really necessary though, just a mobile sized website.A web interface to your own Bitcoin server at home wouldn't be a solution for everyone.

The software would be programmed to start using a new hash after a certain block number. Everyone would have to upgrade by that time. The software could save the new hash of all the old blocks to make sure a different block with the same old hash can't be used. ",

It just needs to be enough for redundancy and fast exponential propagation of messages. 10 would still be plenty. 5 should be fine. 10 is good as a nice round number so users can see that it stopped intentionally.It would help to implement UPnP so there would be more inbound accepting nodes. Your number of connections is the ratio of inbound accepting nodes to out-only times 15. We need to encourage more people to accept inbound connections.I will implement a feature to stop accepting inbound connections once you hit a certain number.Which version are you running?Anyone know how many connections typical P2P software like BitTorrent can get up to?",

It would have to be a country deliberately and totally cutting itself off from the rest of the world.Any node with access to both sides would automatically flow the block chain over, such as someone getting around the blockade with a dial-up modem or sat-phone. It would only take one node to do it. Anyone who wants to keep doing business would be motivated.If the network is segmented and then recombines, any transactions in the shorter fork that were not also in the longer fork are released into the transaction pool again and are eligible to get into future blocks. Their number of confirmations would start over.If anyone took advantage of the segmentation to double-spend, such that there are different spends of the same money on each side, then the double-spends in the shorter fork lose out and go to 0/unconfirmed and stay that way.It wouldn't be easy to take advantage of the segmentation to double-spend. If it's impossible to communicate from one side to the other, how are you going to put a spend on each side? If there is a way, then probably someone else is also using it to flow the block chain over.You would usually know whether you're in the smaller segment.

After I turned this off, the issue was resolved with Runaway CPU.This only seems to affect the 64 bit Client, as the 32 bit Clients I have don't seem to be affected by this.I did notice on the 64 bit Client, what happens is, it spawns multiple \"tray\" icons until X server finally kills over, so I guess I should submit that as a bug to somewhere? That's interesting. I know the minimize to tray on Ubuntu is very clunky, but I didn't know it had a CPU peg problem too. Anyone else able to reproduce this problem? We had this feature disabled on Linux before, but then it seemed better to have the imperfect UI than to lose the feature entirely. I'm thinking we should disable it again on Linux.",

The lightweight client is not implemented yet, but the plan is to implement it when it's needed. For now, everyone just runs a full network node. I anticipate there will never be more than 100K nodes, probably less. It will reach an equilibrium where it's not worth it for more nodes to join in. The rest will be lightweight clients, which could be millions.At equilibrium size, many nodes will be server farms with one or two network nodes that feed the rest of the farm over a LAN.",

The \"About\" box didn't take the translation into account, it still displays the english version to me, even though the rest of the software is using the translated strings, and the .po file contains the translation string of the \"About\" box message. Same problem with the \"Apply\" button in the Settings window.I need to give an updated .po file.Quote from: aidos on July 15, 2010, 12:49:11 AM2. If an transaction's description in the list of transaction in the main window contains a diacritical character (such as \"\u00e9\u00e0\u00e8\u00e7\"), it's not displayed. I suppose the string is not being properly handled as UTF8 somewhere.OK, this must be a problem somewhere, I'll have to take a look at it or one of the other devs can.Quote from: aidos on July 15, 2010, 12:49:11 AM4. About the .po file : - There are a few strings in the .po file that don't needs translation (ie: \"Bitcoin\"). Maybe those shouldn't be inside _(\"...\") ? - Others shouldn't be split. I can remember one message about transaction fee where the string is split in two to insert the fee value, where you could simply have put a %s. It makes the message harder to translate as I had to go in the source to find exactly what was going on. - Some strings have whitespace at the end or start, which necessity is very debatable, and it's easy to miss in PoEdit.Many of the strings are in code automatically generated from uiproject.fbp where nothing can be done about these things. I have a program I use to find all the spacing inconsistencies at the beginning and ending of strings in your .po file and manually fix them up before I upload them to SVN.",

If you run BitCoin in Generate Coin mode, then load up something to eat up all the CPU (like CPU hog for example: http://www.microtask.ca/cpuhog.html) you'll see that both BitCoin and CPU hog share the CPU 50/50 instead of CPU Hog taking all the CPU and BitCoin running only on idle/low process. The khash/s is also reduced in half, so further evidence that the threads are not running in a lower than normal prioirty.I was not able to reproduce this. I have dual-proc, so I ran two memory hogs. Bitcoin got 0% of CPU according to the task manager. The khash/sec meter stayed stuck because it couldn't get any CPU to update it.Do you have dual-proc? Are you sure you weren't running a single processor hog?",

That is so Windows 95ish (just kidding..... Microsoft has so screwed this up that it isn't even funny). I would recommend the registry settings for a number of reasons including the fact that most software puts the startup in that location, even though I personally find the startup folder to be more attractive and how most software on Windows should behave.It could go either way. The Startup folder has the advantage that the end user can see it and manually remove it with the regular UI (not regedit) if they already blew away the Bitcoin directory and its uninstaller. Bitcoin will not relentlessly keep re-adding it if you delete it manually.OpenOffice is another example of something that puts its link in the Startup folder.",

        "post_content": "We need someone to write sample code, preferably Python or Java, showing the recommended way to use the JSON-RPC interface to create an account system. Most sites that sell things will need something like this. Someone who's kept up on the JSON-RPC threads here should have some idea how it should work.When a user is logged in to their account, you show the bitcoin address they can send to to add funds. Before showing it, you check if it's been used, if it has then you replace it with a new one (getnewaddress <username>). You only need to keep the latest bitcoin address for the account in your database. (I posted a sample code fragment for this in an earlier thread somewhere, search on getnewaddress)You use getreceivedbylabel <username> with the username as the label to get the \"credit\" amount of the account. You need to keep a \"debit\" amount in your database. The current balance of the account is (credit - debit). When the user spends money, you increase debit.If you're requiring more than 0 confirmations, it's nice if you show the current balance (0 confirmations) and the available balance (1 or more confirmations), so they can immediately see that their payment is acknowledged. Not all sites need to wait for confirmations, so the dual current & available should be optional. Most sites selling digital goods are fine to accept 0 confirmations. A nice sample app for this would be a simple bank site, which would have the above, plus the option to send a payment to a bitcoin address. The sample code should be the simplest possible with the minimum extra stuff to make it a working site.vekja.net is an example of a site like this.",

Maybe there should be separate queues so one type of demand on addresses doesn't deplete it for the others.The addresses would be created and stored in the normal place, but also listed on a separate list of created-but-never-used addresses. When an address is requested, the address at the front of the never-used queue is handed out, and a new address is created and added to the back.There's some kind of rescan in the block loading code that was made to repair the case where someone copied their wallet.dat.

        "post_content": "I believe it'll be possible for a payment processing company to provide as a service the rapid distribution of transactions with good-enough checking in something like 10 seconds or less.The network nodes only accept the first version of a transaction they receive to incorporate into the block they're trying to generate. When you broadcast a transaction, if someone else broadcasts a double-spend at the same time, it's a race to propagate to the most nodes first. If one has a slight head start, it'll geometrically spread through the network faster and get most of the nodes.A rough back-of-the-envelope example:1     04     116    464    1680%   20%So if a double-spend has to wait even a second, it has a huge disadvantage.The payment processor has connections with many nodes. When it gets a transaction, it blasts it out, and at the same time monitors the network for double-spends. If it receives a double-spend on any of its many listening nodes, then it alerts that the transaction is bad. A double-spent transaction wouldn't get very far without one of the listeners hearing it. The double-spender would have to wait until the listening phase is over, but by then, the payment processor's broadcast has reached most nodes, or is so far ahead in propagating that the double-spender has no hope of grabbing a significant percentage of the remaining nodes.",

Setting up the buffer takes an order of magnitude longer than the actual hashing if you're only hashing one or two blocks like we do. It's intended that the time is amortised if you were hashing many KB or MB of data. In BitcoinMiner, we format the buffer once and keep reusing it.If you can find SHA256 code that's faster (with MinGW/GCC) than what we've got, that would be really great! (although, keep licensing in mind) The one we have is the only one I tried, so there's significant chance for improvement. When I wrote it more than 2 years ago, there were screaming hot SHA1 implementations but minimal attention to SHA256. That's a lot of time for them to come up with better stuff. SHA256 was a lot slower than the fastest SHA1 at the time than I thought it should be. Obviously SHA256 should be slower than SHA1 by a certain amount, but not by as much as I saw.(hope you don't mind I renamed your thread, SHA-256 optimisation is something important that I keep forgetting about)",

Seems overkill.JSON is tempting and I'm inclined to like it, but two main sticking points:1) No comments! How can you have a config file where you can't comment out a line to disable it?2) Not very user friendly to have to \"quote\" all the strings, including the keys, and also have to remember the comma at the end of lines.{ \"key\" : \"value\",}I suppose we could easily preprocess JSON reading the config file one line at a time, truncate the lines at any # character (and/or \"//\"?), concatenate them into a string and pass it to JSON, so you could go:# comment\"key\" : \"value\",  # still have to remember the comma \"key2\" : \"value\",  // comment like this or bothBoost has boost::program_options.We could read lines ourselves and feed them into a map<string, string> mapConfig.while (!eof)read lineif '#' found, truncate linesplit line at first ':' -> key, valuemapConfig.insert(key, value)If we use the syntax:# commentkey : value...and don't allow whitespace indenting before the keys, I guess we would be a subset of YAML and could switch to YAML someday if we need more complexity. If we go with self parsed, that doesn't mean we can't use JSON on particular parameter values as needed. If an option needs a list or more structured data, it could always parse its value as json:key : [\"item1\", \"item2\", \"item3\"]Although it has to be all on one line then.I guess I'm leaning towards self parsed mapConfig:# commentkey : value",

You need to find a collision using a public key for which you know the private key.When you claim a Bitcoin Address transaction, you give your public key that matches the hash, then you must sign it with that key.Red's point is that it's easy to quickly generate insecure public keys which you could break and find the private key after you find a collision.He points out that if the public key was required to be a secure one, one which must have required significant work to find the prime numbers, that would increase the strength above that of the hash function alone.

        "post_content": "QuoteHere is a paper that claims to find SHA-1 collisions in 2^52 crypto operations. And optimally secure hash would take 2^80 operations. 2^52 time is still large, but it is getting into cluster and botnet range.2^80 is if you can use a birthday attack. You can't use a birthday attack for this, so the difficulty is the full 2^160 bits. Although, if you were trying to crack any one of 1 million (2^20) transactions, you could do a partial birthday attack 2^160/2^20 = 2^140.Bitcoin Addresses are the only place where 160-bit hash is used. Everything else is SHA-256. They're calculated as:bitcoinaddress = RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(publickey))Correct me if I'm wrong (please, and I'll gladly eat crow) but I think it would be hard to use an analytical attack on RIPEMD-160 in this case. An analytical attack prescribes a certain range or pattern of inputs to try that will greatly increase your chance of finding a collision. Here, you don't have that kind of control over RIPEMD-160's input, because the input is the output of SHA-256. If an analytical attack helps you find an input to RIPEMD-160 that produces a collision, what are you going to do with it? You still have to get SHA-256 to output that value, so you would still have to break SHA-256 too.For brute force, RIPEMD-160(SHA-256(x)) is no stronger than RIPEMD-160 alone. But for analytical attack, it seems like you must analytical attack both RIPEMD-160 and SHA-256. If I'm wrong, then the strength is the same as RIPEMD-160 and the SHA-256 only serves as one round of key strengthening.",

This is the fastest SHA256 yet using the SSE2 assembly code. Since Bitcoin was sending unaligned data to the block hash function, I had to change the MOVDQA instruction to MOVDQU.I think using the SHA256 functionality from Crypto++ 5.6.0 is the way forward right now.I added a subset of the Crypto++ 5.6.0 library to the SVN. I stripped it down to just SHA and 11 general dependency files. There shouldn't be any other crypto in there other than SHA.I aligned the data fields and it worked. The ASM SHA-256 is about 48% faster. The combined speedup is about 2.5x faster than version 0.3.3.I guess it's using SSE2. It automatically sets its build configuration at compile time based on the compiler environment.It looks like it has some SSE2 detection at runtime, but it's hard to tell if it actually uses it to fall back if it's not available. I want the release builds to have SSE2. SSE2 has been around since the first Pentium 4.

Until we have solid example code using getreceivedbyaddress and getreceivedbylabel to point to and say \"use this! use this! don't use listtransactions!\", I don't think we should implement listtransactions.When we do implement listtransactions, maybe one way to fight that is to make it all text. It should not break down the fields into e.g. comment, confirmations, credit, debit. It could be one pretty formatted string like \"0/unconfirmed  0:0:0 date  comment   debit 4 credit 0\" or something so it's hard for programmers to do the wrong thing and process it.

Their code is too large to read and be sure that there's no way to form an input that would do something unexpected.I hate reinventing the wheel and only resorted to writing my own serialization routines reluctantly. The serialization format we have is as dead simple and flat as possible. There is no extra freedom in the way the input stream is formed. At each point, the next field in the data structure is expected. The only choices given are those that the receiver is expecting. There is versioning so upgrades are possible.CAddress is about the only object with significant reserved space in it. (about 7 bytes for flags and 12 bytes for possible future IPv6 expansion)The larger things we have like blocks and transactions can't be optimized much more for size. The bulk of their data is hashes and keys and signatures, which are uncompressible. The serialization overhead is very small, usually 1 byte for size fields.On Gavin's idea about an existing P2P broadcast infrastructure, I doubt one exists. There are few P2P systems that only need broadcast. There are some libraries like Chord that try to provide a distributed hash table infrastructure, but that's a huge difficult problem that we don't need or want. Those libraries are also much harder to install than ourselves.",

It would be hard to split the world down the middle. More likely it would be a single country vs the rest of the world, lets say a 1:10 split. In that case, it would take the minority fork 10 times as long to generate 100 blocks, so about 7 days. Also it would be super easy for the client to realize it's hearing way too few blocks and something must be wrong.Quote from: knightmb on August 03, 2010, 07:02:13 PMIf there a hard coded limit on split delay? Meaning if I had a small network split from the public network, spent some coin around, came back a few days later and got them sync up to the public network (other than coin generation if it happened) transactions should be fine?There's no time limit. Assuming you weren't spending coins generated in the minority fork, or spending someone's double-spends you received, your transactions can get into the other chain at any time later.",

        "post_content": "Forgot to add the good part about micropayments. While I don't think Bitcoin is practical for smaller micropayments right now, it will eventually be as storage and bandwidth costs continue to fall. If Bitcoin catches on on a big scale, it may already be the case by that time. Another way they can become more practical is if I implement client-only mode and the number of network nodes consolidates into a smaller number of professional server farms. Whatever size micropayments you need will eventually be practical. I think in 5 or 10 years, the bandwidth and storage will seem trivial.I am not claiming that the network is impervious to DoS attack. I think most P2P networks can be DoS attacked in numerous ways. (On a side note, I read that the record companies would like to DoS all the file sharing networks, but they don't want to break the anti-hacking/anti-abuse laws.)If we started getting DoS attacked with loads of wasted transactions back and forth, you would need to start paying a 0.01 minimum transaction fee. 0.1.5 actually had an option to set that, but I took it out to reduce confusion. Free transactions are nice and we can keep it that way if people don't abuse them.That brings up the question: if there was a minimum 0.01 fee for each transaction, should we automatically add the fee if it's just the minimum 0.01? It would be awfully annoying to ask each time. If you have 50.00 and send 10.00, the recipient would get 10.00 and you'd have 39.99 left. I think it should just add it automatically. It's trivial compared to the fees many other types of services add automatically.Quote from: FreeMoney on August 04, 2010, 07:30:32 PMDoes including more slow down your hashing rate?

This rule makes it impossible to pay for a simple \"search query\" with no further transactions.One alternative is to use a round-up system. You pay for, say, 1000 pages or images or downloads or searches or whatever at a time. When you've used up your 1000 pages, you pay for another 1000 pages. If you only use 1 page, then you have 999 left that you may never use, but it's not a big deal because the cost per 1000 is still small.Or you could pay per day. The first time you access the site on a given day, you pay for 24 hours of access.Per 1000 or per day may be easier for consumers to get their heads around too.

        "post_content": "It's the same situation as gold and gold mining. The marginal cost of gold mining tends to stay near the price of gold. Gold mining is a waste, but that waste is far less than the utility of having gold available as a medium of exchange.I think the case will be the same for Bitcoin. The utility of the exchanges made possible by Bitcoin will far exceed the cost of electricity used. Therefore, not having Bitcoin would be the net waste.Quote from: gridecon on August 06, 2010, 04:48:00 PMAs an overall point, I also do not agree with the idea that the very high computational burden of coin generation is in fact a necessity of the current system. As I understand it, currency creation is fundamentally metered by TIME - and if that is the fundamental controlling variable, what is the need for everyone to \"roll as many dice as posible\" within that given time period? The \"chain of proof\" for coin ownership and transactions doesn't depend on the method for spawning coins. Each node's influence on the network is proportional to its CPU power. The only way to show the network how much CPU power you have is to actually use it.If there's something else each person has a finite amount of that we could count for one-person-one-vote, I can't think of it. IP addresses... much easier to get lots of them than CPUs.I suppose it might be possible to measure CPU power at certain times. For instance, if the CPU power challenge was only run for an average of 1 minute every 10 minutes. You could still prove your total power at given times without running it all the time. I'm not sure how that could be implemented though. There's no way for a node that wasn't present at the time to know that a past chain was actually generated in a duty cycle with 9 minute breaks, not back to back.Proof-of-work has the nice property that it can be relayed through untrusted middlemen. We don't have to worry about a chain of custody of communication. It doesn't matter who tells you a longest chain, the proof-of-work speaks for itself.",

        "post_content": "Here's an outline of the kind of escrow transaction that's possible in software. This is not implemented and I probably won't have time to implement it soon, but just to let you know what's possible.The basic escrow: The buyer commits a payment to escrow. The seller receives a transaction with the money in escrow, but he can't spend it until the buyer unlocks it. The buyer can release the payment at any time after that, which could be never. This does not allow the buyer to take the money back, but it does give him the option to burn the money out of spite by never releasing it. The seller has the option to release the money back to the buyer.While this system does not guarantee the parties against loss, it takes the profit out of cheating.If the seller doesn't send the goods, he doesn't get paid. The buyer would still be out the money, but at least the seller has no monetary motivation to stiff him.The buyer can't benefit by failing to pay. He can't get the escrow money back. He can't fail to pay due to lack of funds. The seller can see that the funds are committed to his key and can't be sent to anyone else.Now, an economist would say that a fraudulent seller could start negotiating, such as \"release the money and I'll give you half of it back\", but at that point, there would be so little trust and so much spite that negotiation is unlikely. Why on earth would the fraudster keep his word and send you half if he's already breaking his word to steal it? I think for modest amounts, almost everyone would refuse on principle alone.",

In the original source file, there is no break statement in this critical block. I think you must remove lines 2759-2762. The is nothing like that in the original main.cpp.Sorry about that. CRITICAL_BLOCK isn't perfect. You have to be careful not to break or continue out of it. There's an assert that catches and warns about break. I can be criticized for using it, but the syntax would be so much more bloated and error prone without it.Is there a chance the SSE2 code is slow on Intel because of some quirk that could be worked around? For instance, if something works but is slow if it's not aligned, or thrashing the cache, or one type of instruction that's really slow? I'm not sure how available it is, but I think Intel used to have a profiler for profiling on a per instruction level. I guess if tcatm doesn't have a system with the slow processor to test with, there's not much hope. But it would be really nice if this was working on most CPUs.",

It's the need to check for the absence of double-spends that requires global knowledge of all transactions.The challenge is, how do you prove that no other spends exist? It seems a node must know about all transactions to be able to verify that. If it only knows the hash of the in/outpoints, it can't check the signatures to see if an outpoint has been spent before. Do you have any ideas on this?It's hard to think of how to apply zero-knowledge-proofs in this case.We're trying to prove the absence of something, which seems to require knowing about all and checking that the something isn't included.",

I would certainly not endorse that.Then you must also be against the common system of payment up front, where the customer loses.Payment up front: customer loses, and the thief gets the money.Simple escrow: customer loses, but the thief doesn't get the money either.Are you guys saying payment up front is better, because at least the thief gets the money, so at least someone gets it?Imagine someone stole something from you. You can't get it back, but if you could, if it had a kill switch that could be remote triggered, would you do it? Would it be a good thing for thieves to know that everything you own has a kill switch and if they steal it, it'll be useless to them, although you still lose it too? If they give it back, you can re-activate it.Imagine if gold turned to lead when stolen. If the thief gives it back, it turns to gold again.It still seems to me the problem may be one of presenting it the right way. For one thing, not being so blunt about \"money burning\" for the purposes of game theory discussion. The money is never truly burned. You have the option to release it at any time forever.",

It doesn't know what transactions or amounts they belong to. A client can find out if an outpoint has been spent, and it can submit a satisfying inpoint to mark it spent. The network keeps the outpoint and the first valid inpoint that proves it spent. The inpoint signs a hash of its associated next outpoint and a salt, so it can privately be shown that the signature signs a particular next outpoint if you know the salt, but publicly the network doesn't know what the next outpoint is.I believe the clients would have to keep the entire history back to the original generated coins. Someone sending a payment would have to send data to the recipient, as well as still communicating with the network to mark outpoints spent and check that the spend is the first spend. Maybe the data transfer could be done as an e-mail attachment.The fact that clients have to keep the entire history reduces the privacy benefit. Someone handling a lot of money still gets to see a lot of transaction history. The way it retrospectively fans out, they might end up seeing a majority of the history. Denominations could be made granular to limit fan-out, but a business handling a lot of money might still end up seeing a lot of the history.",

New nodes could accept old transactions for a long time until most nodes have already upgraded before starting to refuse transactions without PoW. Or, they could always accept old transactions, but only a limited number per time period.I've thought about PoW on transactions many times, but usually I end up thinking a 0.01 transaction fee is essentially similar and better. 0.01 is basically a proof of work, but not wasted. But if the problem is validating loads of transactions, then PoW could be checked faster.A more general umbrella partial solution would be to implement the idea where an unlikely dropoff in blocks received is detected. Then an attacker would still need a substantial portion of the network's power to benefit from a DoS attack.Quote from: gavinandresen on August 11, 2010, 04:10:56 PMBitcoin's p2p network is subject to various kinds of denial of service attacks.There, I said it.+1Any demonstration tests at this point would only show what we already know, and divert dev time from strengthening the system to operational fire fighting.",

The fact that clients have to keep the entire history reduces the privacy benefit. I thought this too at first. But then I convinced myself otherwise.Are you back to talking about the existing Bitcoin system here?I was talking about in the hypothetical system I was describing, if the network doesn't know the values and lineage of the transactions, then it can't verify them and vouch for them, so the clients would have to keep the history all the way back.If a client wasn't present until recently, the two ways to convince it that a transaction has a valid past is:1) Show it the entire history back to the original generated coin.2) Show it a history back to a thoroughly deep block, then trust that if so many nodes all said the history up to then was correct then it must be true.But if the network didn't know all the values and lineage of the transactions, it couldn't do 2), I don't think.",

        "post_content": "I'm not grasping your idea yet. Does it hide any information from the public network? What is the advantage?If at least 50% of nodes validated transactions enough that old transactions can be discarded, then everyone saw everything and could keep a record of it.Can public nodes see the values of transactions? Can they see which previous transaction the value came from? If they can, then they know everything. If they can't, then they couldn't verify that the value came from a valid source, so you couldn't take their generated chain as verification of it.Does it hide the bitcoin addresses? Is that it? OK, maybe now I see, if that's it.Crypto may offer a way to do \"key blinding\". I did some research and it was obscure, but there may be something there. \"group signatures\" may be related.There's something here in the general area:http://www.users.zetnet.co.uk/hopwood/crypto/rh/What we need is a way to generate additional blinded variations of a public key. The blinded variations would have the same properties as the root public key, such that the private key could generate a signature for any one of them. Others could not tell if a blinded key is related to the root key, or other blinded keys from the same root key. These are the properties of blinding. Blinding, in a nutshell, is x = (x * large_random_int) mod m.When paying to a bitcoin address, you would generate a new blinded key for each use.Then you need to be able to sign a signature such that you can't tell that two signatures came from the same private key. I'm not sure if always signing a different blinded public key would already give you this property. If not, I think that's where group signatures comes in. With group signatures, it is possible for something to be signed but not know who signed it.As an example, say some unpopular military attack has to be ordered, but nobody wants to go down in history as the one who ordered it. If 10 leaders have private keys, one of them could sign the order and you wouldn't know who did it.",

        "post_content": "Some places where generation will gravitate to:1) places where it's cheapest or free2) people who want to help for idealogical reasons3) people who want to get some coins without the inconvenience of doing a transaction to buy themThere are legitimate places where it's free. Generation is basically free anywhere that has electric heat, since your computer's heat is offsetting your baseboard electric heating. Many small flats have electric heat out of convenience.How expensive is heating oil? With the price of oil so high, if it's actually more expensive than electric, then generating would have negative cost.There's also kids putting it on their parent's power bill, employees their employer, botnets, etc.Case 3 comes into play for small amounts. The overhead of doing an exchange doesn't make sense if you just need a small bit of pocket change for incidental micropayments. I think this is a nice advantage vs fiat currency, instead of all the seigniorage going to one big entity, let it go in convenience amounts to people who need to scrape up a small amount of change.",

Silly questions:1) How will this continue to affect version 3.8.1 (pre-catastrophe) clients with bad block chain?2) How will this affect clients that upgrade to 3.8.10 but don't remove their block chain files?1) Once more than 50% of the node power is upgraded and the good chain overtakes the bad, the 0.3.10 nodes will make it hard for any bad transactions to get any confirmations. 2) If you didn't remove your blk*.dat files, you're not helping to contribute to that 50%, and you'll still show bad transactions until the good chain overtakes the bad chain.",

(I haven't tested this yet) It checks all the blocks in the main chain. If it finds a bad one, it sets all that chain's bnChainWork to 0 so it can't win best chain again, and it reduces best chain work to the fork level so any new block after the fork will cause a reorg. (It can't change pindexBest without actually doing a reorg)This isn't perfect yet. It still needs to receive one valid block to trigger the reorg. It would probably be possible to initiate an AddToBlockIndex or Reorganize after the check, but it would require a lot more careful attention. I probably should break out part of AddToBlockIndex that sets the new best block. I'll probably end up doing that instead of the code below.Code:bool CTxDB::LoadBlockIndex(){ ... // Verify blocks in the main chain vector<CBlockIndex*> vChain; for (CBlockIndex* pindex = pindexBest; pindex && pindex->pprev; pindex = pindex->pprev) {   vChain.push_back(pindex);   CBlock block;   if (!block.ReadFromDisk(pindex))     return error(\"LoadBlockIndex() : block.ReadFromDisk failed\");   if (!block.CheckBlock())   {     bnBestChainWork = pindex->pprev->bnChainWork;     foreach(CBlockIndex* pindex2, vChain)       pindex2->bnChainWork = 0;   } } return true;}",

Technically, yes, the genesis block is a block. It's a hardcoded block that you start out with. You can't not have the genesis block. Maybe think of it as a reference coin that you measure other coins against. The block count people are looking for is the number of blocks they've downloaded.The main benefit is that blocks will be equal to the block number of the current best block. If blocks is 10, then the highest block number you have is 10.

The numbers start at 0, so when your client shows there are 74638 blocks then that means you have up to block number 74637, the last good one.",

On the other side, as far as I know WxWidgets uses gtk under Linux for drawing the whole stuff and makes it for the bitcoins devs easy to make things cross platform.wxWidgets 2.9 is their first UTF-8 version. We are UTF-8 on all platforms including Windows.The distro packages of 2.8 are UTF-16, so they just trip people up. People had endless build problems with 2.8 and its wxString UTF-16/ANSI conditional build options until we standardized on 2.9. Also, to use 2.8, we were using ANSI, which was just a temporary stopgap until wxWidgets supported UTF-8.This is a problem that will solve itself.

I believe the safer option should be enabled by default. If you want your server to keep trading and ignore an alert saying the money its receiving might be like the money from the overflow bug, then you can use the switch and not blame anyone else if you lose your money.Worst case if you leave alerts enabled, your site stops trading until you upgrade or add the -disablesafemode switch.Getting surprised by some temporary down time when your node would otherwise be at risk is better than getting surprised by a thief draining all your inventory.Someday when we haven't found any new bugs for a long time and it has been thoroughly security reviewed without finding anything, this can be scaled back.

It's tempting because it's so easily available as a package; a lot of people were frustrated by it until we started hardcoding 2.9 into the makefile.",

It would be very easy to make the software automatically check the size of recent blocks to see if it should pay a fee. We're so far from reaching the threshold, we don't need that yet. It's a good idea to see how things go with controlling it manually first anyway.It's not a big deal if we reach the threshold. Free transactions would just take longer to get into a block.I did a rough tally of 4000 blocks from around 74000-78000. This is excluding the block reward transactions:There were average 2 transactions per block, 17 transactions per hour, 400 transactions per day.Average transaction bytes per block was 428 bytes, or 214 bytes per transaction.The current threshold is 200KB per block, or about 1000 transactions per block. I think it should be lowered to 50KB per block. That would still be more than 100 times the average transactions per block.The threshold can easily be changed in the future. We can decide to increase it when the time comes. It's a good idea to keep it lower as a circuit breaker and increase it as needed. If we hit the threshold now, it would almost certainly be some kind of flood and not actual use. Keeping the threshold lower would help limit the amount of wasted disk space in that event.",

I have a quad-core generating 4,300 hashes-per-second, so I am estimating a 24-core machine could mine bitcoins at 25,000 hashes-per-second.AMD Phenom (I think 4-core) CPUs are doing about 11,000khps with -4way, about 100% speedup. 24 cores should get 66,000khps. AMD is the best choice because it has the best SSE2 implementation. (or maybe because tcatm had an AMD and optimised his code for that)There's been so much else to do that I haven't had time to make -4way automatic. For now you still have to do it manually.http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=820.0",

        "post_content": "SVN rev 150 has some code to try to auto-detect whether to use 4-way SSE2. We need this because it's only faster on certain newer CPUs that have 128-bit SSE2 and not ones with 64-bit SSE2.It uses the CPUID instruction to get the CPU brand, family, model number and stepping. That's the easy part. Knowing what to do with the model number is the hard part. I was not able to find any table of family, model and stepping numbers for CPUs. I had to go by various random reports I saw.Here's what I ended up with:Code: // We need Intel Nehalem or AMD K10 or better for 128bit SSE2// Nehalem = i3/i5/i7 and some Xeon// K10 = Opterons with 4 or more cores, Phenom, Phenom II, Athlon II// Intel Core i5 family 6, model 26 or 30// Intel Core i7 family 6, model 26 or 30// Intel Core i3 family 6, model 37// AMD Phenom  family 16, model 10bool fUseSSE2 = ((fIntel && nFamily * 10000 + nModel >= 60026) ||         (fAMD  && nFamily * 10000 + nModel >= 160010));I saw some sporadic inconsistent model numbers for AMD CPUs, so I'm not sure if this will catch all capable AMDs.If it's wrong, you can still override it with -4way or -4way=0.It prints what it finds in debug.log. Search on CPUID.This is only enabled if built with GCC.",

Random unidentified payments volunteered to the server's IP address would be unhelpful.In general, sending by IP has limited useful cases. If connecting directly without a proxy, the man-in-the-middle risk may be tolerable, but no privacy. If you use a privacy proxy, man-in-the-middle risk is unacceptably high.

That would still be more than 100 times the average transactions per block.I implemented this change in SVN rev 157.The reason I previously made it so high was to allow very large transactions without hitting the transaction fee. The threshold was around 26,000 BTC for transactions made of 50 BTC generated coins. Even though it was 100 times easier to generate back then, only a few people ever encountered the fee at that level. The new threshold puts it at around 11,000 BTC for sending generated coins. It would mostly only be reached with generated bitcoins. If you bought your bitcoins, they'll be denominated in larger transactions and won't be anywhere near the fee limit, unless you bought them in several hundred separate transactions.

It's described here:http://bitcointalk.org/index.php?topic=750.0It's absolutely safer than a straight payment without escrow, but not as good as a human arbitrated escrow, assuming you trust the human enough.In this kind of escrow, a cheater can't win, but it's still possible for you to lose. It at least takes away the profit motive for cheating you. The seller is assured that the money is reserved for him, while the buyer retains the leverage that the seller hasn't been paid yet until completion.",

        "post_content": "As you figured out, the root problem is we shouldn't be counting or spending transactions until they have at least 1 confirmation. 0/unconfirmed transactions are very much second class citizens. At most, they are advice that something has been received, but counting them as balance or spending them is premature.I made changes so they show up in lighter print, with the credit amount in square brackets like [+1.23], and the amount not counted towards your balance and not available for spending. This doesn't apply to transactions you sent, which you implicitly trust, since you wrote them.I didn't make it (+1.23) because parenthesis in accounting means negative. I hope square brackets is different enough to be clear what is meant.The JSON-RPC interface can still see 0/unconfirmed if it wants by specifying 0 confirmations.I uploaded the changes to SVN rev 158. I will post a 0.3.13 RC shortly.If you have any of these transactions in your wallet, do not send any payments until you've upgraded to 0.3.13, which will be coming soon.If you've already sent any of these transactions, or you're the creator of them, then use theymos' patch or make the following change and use it to send your clean transactions to a new wallet to clean things up.change:  if (pcoin->GetDepthInMainChain() < 1 && pcoin->GetDebit() <= 0)    continue;to:  if (pcoin->GetDepthInMainChain() < 1)    continue;",

If you have a transaction that is displayed as 0/unconfirmed, then you have all the previous unrecorded transactions it depends on and you will also rebroadcast those transactions when you rebroadcast yours.If a no-fee block has already been generated and hasn't helped, then I need to look at what's wrong.

Hashing more data is slower than hashing less data, so the block header is critically of a fixed size for everyone, with one exception.This is the point of confusion. extraNonce is not part of the block header, it is part of the first transaction. It does not slow down your hashing. It does not change the size of the header.We need to be vigilant and nip in the bud any misconception that the contents of your block slows down your hash speed. It doesn't.extraNonce never needs to be very big. We could reset it every second whenever the time changes if we wanted. Worst case, if you didn't want to keep track of incrementing it, extraNonce could be 4 random bytes and the chance of wasting time from collision would be negligible.Separate machines are automatically collision proof because they have different generated public keys in the first transaction. That also goes for each thread too.",

Priority is sum(valuein * age) / txsize. Transaction fee still takes precedence over priority, and priority determines the order of processing within a fee strata.In support of the priority feature, SelectCoins only uses your own 0 conf transactions only as a last resort if that's all you have left.

Or managing how much priority you spend on a transaction. The software would have to know your future plans to know whether to spend your priority now or save it for later. I don't think we'll need to get into that much detail though. There's a wide enough difference between normal users and flooders.Priority doesn't have to do everything. Once you know there's a flood, you can add -paytxfee=0.01. Hopefully with priority, your transactions before that should be at worst slow, not stuck.",

Said another way, perhaps a generation rule that says that a free transaction must be 3 blocks deep before it can be transfered again for free. This will still allow real users to immediately spend new funds if they have to, while still permitting real users to reshuffle funds to suit their needs without an overhead cost. I think that this would significantly inhibit the type of spamming attack that is currently underway.I'm doing something like that. Priority is a more formalised version of the concept you're describing.Quote from: FreeMoney on November 19, 2010, 05:39:44 PMAs it stands now 3.15 has a lot of free transaction space and that space is given first to transactions with the highest [age]*[value]/[size] correct? Would it be reasonable to make some arbitrary portion of the free space require [age]*[value]/[size] > C ?Maybe set C so that a standard 1BTC transaction can get into the main free area on the next block. And a .1 can get in after waiting about 10 blocks. And make the area which allows [age]*[value]/[size] < C to let in about a dozen transactions or so.Yes, like this. And the no-priority-requirement area is 3K, about a dozen transactions per block.I just uploaded SVN rev 185 which has a minimal priority requirement for free transactions. Transaction floods are made up of coins that are re-spent over and over, so they depend on their own 0 conf transactions repeatedly. 0 conf transactions have 0 priority, so free transactions like that will have to wait for one transaction to get into a block at a time.Version 0.3.15 doesn't write transactions using 0 conf dependencies unless that's all it has left, so normal users shouldn't usually have a problem with this.I think this is a good compromise short of making the default fee 0.01. It's not so much to ask that free transactions can only be used to turn coins over so often. If you're using free transactions, you're taking charity and there has to be some limit on how often you can use it with the same coins.We've always said free transactions may be processed more slowly. You can help ensure your transactions go through quickly by adding -paytxfee=0.01.",

It's quite unclear whether or not 'data' and 'nonce' must be byte-reversed, and in what way.getwork does the byte-reversing. midstate, data and hash1 are already big-endian, and you pass data back still big-endian, so you work in big-endian and don't have to do any byte-reversing. They're the same data that is passed to the ScanHash_ functions. You can take midstate, data and hash1, put them in 16-byte aligned buffers and pass them to a ScanHash_ function, like ScanHash(pmidstate, pdata + 64, phash1, nHashesDone). If a nonce is found, patch it into data and call getwork.I should probably change the ScanHash_ functions to use pdata instead of pdata + 64 so they're consistent.target is little endian, it's supposed to be the same as how m0mchil's did it. (if it's not, then it should be fixed) That's the only case where you would use byte reverse.

        "post_content": "It seems like you're inclined to assume everything is wrong more than is actually so.Writing the block index is light work. Building the tx index is much more random access per block. I suspect reading all the prev txins is what's slow. Read caching would help that. It's best if the DB does that. Maybe it has a setting for how much cache memory to use.Quote1) bitcoin should be opening databases, not just environment, at program startup, and closing database at program shutdown. Already does that. See CDB. The lifetime of the (for instance) CTxDB object is only to support database transactions and to know if anything is still using the database at shutdown.QuoteAnd, additionally, bitcoin forces a database checkpoint, pushing all transactions from log into main database.If it was doing that it would be much slower. It's supposed to be only once a minute or 500 blocks: if (strFile == \"blkindex.dat\" && IsInitialBlockDownload() && nBestHeight % 500 != 0)   nMinutes = 1; dbenv.txn_checkpoint(0, nMinutes, 0);Probably should add this: if (!fReadOnly)   dbenv.txn_checkpoint(0, nMinutes, 0);Quote2) For the initial block download, txn commit should occur once every N records, not every record. I suggest N=1000.Does transaction commit imply flush? That seems surprising to me. I assume a database op wrapped in a transaction would be logged like any other database op. Many database applications need to wrap almost every pair of ops in a transaction, such as moving money from one account to another. (debit a, credit b) I can't imagine they're required to batch all their stuff up themselves.In the following cases, would case 1 flush once and case 2 flush twice?case 1:writewritewritewritecheckpointcase 2:begin transactionwritewritecommit transactionbegin transactionwritewritecommit transactioncheckpointContorting our database usage will not be the right approach. It's going to be BDB settings and caching.",

Past transactions can become unconfirmed, go away and come back, become invalid and disappear, or be replaced by a different double-spend. Their date can change, their order can change.Programmers are naturally inclined to want to use listtransactions like this: feed me the new transactions since I last asked, and I'll keep my own tally or static record of them. This will seem to work in all regular use, but if you use the amounts for anything, it is highly exploitable:1) How do you know if a past transaction becomes invalid and disappears?2) When there's a block-chain reorg, it would be easy to double-count transactions when they get confirmed again.3) A transaction can be replaced by a double-spend with a different txid. You would count both spends.The model where you assume you only need to see new transactions because you've already seen previous transactions is not true. Old transactions can change at any time.Any time you take an action based on payment amounts received, you always need to go back to bitcoin and ask for a current balance total (or use move or sendfrom), and be ready for the possibility that it can go down.Now that we have the Accounts feature making it easier to do it the right way, we're better prepared to have listtransactions.",

A solution may be for just one of the networks if one network has a lower difficulty.I think an external miner could call getwork on both programs and combine the work. Maybe call Bitcoin, get work from it, hand it to BitDNS getwork to combine into a combined work.Instead of fragmentation, networks share and augment each other's total CPU power. This would solve the problem that if there are multiple networks, they are a danger to each other if the available CPU power gangs up on one. Instead, all networks in the world would share combined CPU power, increasing the total strength. It would make it easier for small networks to get started by tapping into a ready base of miners.",

If you solve it, it will solve a block from both Bitcoin and BitDNS. In concept, they're tied together by a Merkle Tree. To hand it in to Bitcoin, you break off the BitDNS branch, and to hand it in to BitDNS, you break off the Bitcoin branch.In practice, to retrofit it for Bitcoin, the BitDNS side would have to have maybe ~200 extra bytes, but that's not a big deal. You've been talking about 50 domains per block, which would dwarf that little 200 bytes per block for backward compatibility. We could potentially schedule a far in future block when Bitcoin would upgrade to a modernised arrangement with the Merkle Tree on top, if we care enough about saving a few bytes.Note that the chains are below this new Merkle Tree. That is, each of Bitcoin and BitDNS have their own chain links inside their blocks.

These chain-specific coins would be used to reward miners on those chains, and to purchase some kinds of rights or privileges within the domain of that chain?Right, the exchange rate between domains and bitcoins would float.A longer interval than 10 minutes would be appropriate for BitDNS.So far in this discussion there's already a lot of housekeeping data required. It will be much easier if you can freely use all the space you need without worrying about paying fees for expensive space in Bitcoin's chain. Some transactions:Changing the IP record.Name change. A domain object could entitle you to one domain, and you could change it at will to any name that isn't taken. This would encourage users to free up names they don't want anymore. Generated domains start out blank and the miner sells it to someone who changes it to what they want. Renewal. Could be free, or maybe require consuming another domain object to renew. In that case, domain objects (domaincoins?) could represent the right to own a domain for a year. The spent fee goes to the miners in the next block fee.",

All transactions, IP changes, renewals, etc. should have some fee that goes to the miners.You might consider a certain amount of work to generate a domain, instead of a fixed total circulation. The work per domain could be on a schedule that grows with Moore's Law. That way the number of domains would grow with demand and the number of people using it.",

And CA problem solved, neat.2) Pick one TLD, .web +1.3) Expiration and significant renewal costs, very important.Quote from: joe on December 11, 2010, 10:53:58 AMHowever, thinking more about this now I support inclusion of additional coinbases / tracking systems in the main network. The reason for doing this is so as not to water down CPU power into multiple networks. We want one strong network, so the network should be versatile.Avoiding CPU power fragmentation is no longer a reason. Independent networks/chains can share CPU power without sharing much else.

The build for this is version 0.3.19.- Added some DoS controlsAs Gavin and I have said clearly before, the software is not at all resistant to DoS attack. This is one improvement, but there are still more ways to attack than I can count. I'm leaving the -limitfreerelay part as a switch for now and it's there if you need it.- Removed \"safe mode\" alerts\"safe mode\" alerts was a temporary measure after the 0.3.9 overflow bug. We can say all we want that users can just run with \"-disablesafemode\", but it's better just not to have it for the sake of appearances. It was never intended as a long term feature. Safe mode can still be triggered by seeing a longer (greater total PoW) invalid block chain.Builds:http://sourceforge.net/projects/bitcoin/files/Bitcoin/bitcoin-0.3.19/",
