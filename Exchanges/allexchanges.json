    "description": "SpiritSwap is a decentralized exchange (DEX) on the Fantom Opera Chain. SpiritSwap's design is based on the Uniswap constant-product automated market maker (AMM). In an AMM, liquidity providers simply deposit a pair of tokens and an algorithm automatically makes markets for the token pair. Traders can easily swap between tokens in the AMM and get guaranteed rates for the swaps. Each swap on SpiritSwap incurs a fee, which gets distributed to liquidity providers and $SPIRIT stakers.",

    "description": "The Vision -\r\nDFX is a decentralized foreign exchange protocol optimized for trading fiat-backed foreign stablecoins.\r\nThe next generation of global finance cannot rely solely on USD-pegged stablecoins. A decentralized protocol where users can efficiently exchange stablecoins pegged to various foreign currencies is not only important, but necessary.\r\nDFX is the protocol for the exchange of foreign stablecoins.\r\n\r\nThe Parts -\r\nIn order to create a global platform for trading fiat-backed stablecoins, several pieces will be required:\r\nAn AMM optimized for efficient swaps\r\nStablecoin issuers (in various countries)\r\n\r\nLiquidity providers -\r\nAn automated market maker (AMM) on Ethereum allows the decentralized exchange of tokens according to a bonding curve. For DFX, this curve will be dynamically adjusted by using real world FX price feeds from ChainLink to ensure that you get the best rates for Non-USD Stablecoins like CADC, EURS, XSGD, etc.\r\nWorking with stablecoin issuers in foreign countries and their local crypto on-ramps will be necessary to onboard the masses into DeFi. DFX aims to create partnerships with stablecoin issuers around the world and help them bootstrap the usage of their tokens to the world.\r\nYou can safely earn yield or use the DFX platform and contracts to provide true financial localization for the customers of your global business.\r\n\r\nA decentralized protocol where users can efficiently exchange stablecoins pegged to various foreign currencies isn\u2019t only important, but necessary. DFX Finance is that protocol for the exchange of foreign stablecoins.

This will be achieved by using a single large-degree node (the RADIO node) to create what they refer to as The Starfish Topology: a pairing of the single large node with all swappable pairs.",
