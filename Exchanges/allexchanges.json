    "description": "OccamX is an high-throughput DEX tailor made for Cardano native tokens and more, developed by a seasoned team of blockchain professionals supported by Occam Occelerator program. Backed by both IOHK through the cFund and EMURGO, OccamX is going to unleash vast liquidity for existing CNTs, including some of those that launch through IDOs on partnered multi-chain launchpad OccamRazer.\r\n\r\nUtilizing Milkomeda enables OccamX to launch with full capacity much sooner than could have been realized on the Cardano mainnet alone. This is essential to provide deep liquidity to the array of Cardano Native Tokens (CNTs) and tokens from EVM-based chains waiting for trading opportunities.",
