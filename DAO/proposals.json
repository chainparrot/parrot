    "title": "[WIP #17 Stopping Rebases]",
    "description": "In January Wonderland transitioned to wMEMO and introduced non dillutive mints. Shortly after, minting was turned off following the price crash leaving rebases with no real purpose.\n\nObjective:\nTo stop the rebasing of MEMO.\n\nProvide a High-Level Overview:\nAs we have moved away from the principle OHM mechanics (minting/bonding) of TIME and from TIME being the token focus of Wonderland, the rebasing of MEMO is now just a legacy feature.\n\nIt is being proposed that the core team put a stop to the mechanism and remove the information related to it.\n\nTurning off rebasing will complete our transition from an OMH fork, and push us more to focus the community on what we are now.\n\nThis will also set the stage for Wonderland\u2019s future.\n\nProvide Low-Level Details:\nRebases are a token split.\n\nEvery rebases, the price of TIME/MEMO adjusts for the split so even though you have more tokens, it\u2019s not worth more, unless the price goes up.\n\nThe main focus should be on the price of wMEMO. Keeping in mind that the profits to be gained while holding are by staking wMEMO in the farm for revenue share and from market price action.\n\nThe end the confusion, it\u2019s proposed to stop the rebases.\n\nBusiness and/or technical requirements of the implementation of the proposal:\nThe Core Team will disable the rebases and update the dApp to ensure there is no confusion as the APY, Next Reward Amount/Yield and ROI (5-day), etc. will now be obsolete.\n\nUser should will still be able to stake TIME, but should not be able to unstake. Users should be wrapping their MEMO and use wMEMO instead.",

    "description": "I propose to increase the APR of staking and liquidity providing to reward the active users of Pancakeswap.\n\nWith low APRs (and getting lower due to votes) we are not incentivising people to use Pancakeswap directly, if CAKE has little to no emmisions at all why use Pancakeswap? Just hold your CAKE in an exchange, much easier.\n\nI don't think people fully understand the effect of emissions, think of emissions as a company giving stock dividends instead of cash, let's say 4% stock dividend, nothing happens at all, because everybody gets 4% (This is not the case for Pancakeswap since we have burns).\n\nHowever not all CAKE holders get the best returns. Let's go back to the dividend example, some people get the 4%, some don't, in this scenario the 4% return guy actually gets something because he gets more compared to others. This is a good way to reward people who actually use Pancakeswap.\n\nIf CAKE emmisions go to zero, there will be no more staking and rewards for providing liquidity is very low. What do you think will happen to Pancakeswap if that occurs?\n\nHere's another one, people just get excited over high APRs even if it's pure inflation. (to reiterate CAKE is not purely inflationary due to burns).\n\nFrom what I see most people want CAKE to be deflationary, which is great, but not the best option. If what you want is to get the maximum amount of value, increasing emissions is the best option. If you're reading this you're one of the people going to benefit from higher emissions. \n\nI'm not proposing to increase the emissions to max immediately, there are people who want the exact opposite of what I'm proposing after all. \n\nDeflation can still be achieved, what we need to do is focus on deflationary products, instead of trying to force it through lower emissions.\n\nWe get more burns if more people use the platform, increasing emissions will get us more users.\n\nThank you for reading, let's continue to make this a great community.",

The use of Cake would be multiplied, because it would have an interesting use case. It would also be adding networks by voting of verified users, only because they are the ones who mainly use the function.\nAdd the general function to the world: Switching networks, Voting for new networks, using Cake for rates.\nAdd the function for users with profile: Change of networks, Voting for new networks, use of Cake for rates.\nLeave everything the same, no network switching function.\nAgregar soporte de pasar entre varias Blockchain iniciando en BSC, por ejemplo y volver a ella f\u00e1cilmente. Solo con perfiles verificados de PancakeSwap para poder habilitar esta interesante funci\u00f3n muy solicitado en el ambiente criptogr\u00e1fico. Que con esta funci\u00f3n se pague el paso entre cadenas con Cake, nuestro toquen favorito de la red BSC, se aumenta la quema y se \u201cmantiene\u201d el pool auto-manual. El uso de Cake seria multiplicado, porque este tendr\u00eda un caso de uso interesante. Seria tambi\u00e9n agregar redes por votaci\u00f3n de usuarios verificados, solamente porque son los que usuarios la funci\u00f3n principalmente.\nAgregar la funci\u00f3n general al mundo: Cambio de redes, Votaciones para nuevas redes, uso de Cake para tarifas.\nAgregar la funci\u00f3n para usuarios con perfil: Cambio de redes, Votaciones para nuevas redes, uso de Cake para tarifas.\nDejar todo igual, sin funci\u00f3n de cambio de redes.",

In between 5 to 20 there would be 100 sell/buy orders. So imagine the account of trading fees and lp rewards being generated. This would mean more cake will be burnt and more rewards will be given.

As for pancakeswap it would be like setting a deadline to have 0 emissions or below before we hit the max supply. \n\nHere is the plan:\nMaximum supply will be set at 500m which would take over 2 years for it to hit. Pancakeswap will do everything within 2 years to bring emissions down to 0 or negative to prevent it hitting 500m.\n\nIf pancakeswap fails to achieve it then once we hit 500m cake all new minting will be paused and rewards will be given out from NFT fees, IFO, transaction fees etc....  Please note by then we may have even features that would burn cake like gamification, margin, lending and borrowing. \n\n\n\n",

If you choose to sell/buy the token there will be a 5% tax so keeping/farming your own is encouraged. \n\nBenefitting Cake\n1. Less people will be staking in normal pools/farms = higher APY\n2. A new cake nft token can give you another source of income that could be better than current farms. \n3. Cake will have higher demand\n\nNote: figures can be changed, but its just an example of a system that i think will benefit cake. ",

    "description": "An option to burn cake voluntary. For every cake you burn you will earn 1 cake point and be added to a leader board of cake burners.\n\nLeader boards\n- all time\n- yearly\n- monthly\n- weekly\n- daily\n\nI believe this will be a very effective way to burn cake without needing anything special except for a leader board and points added to profile. \n\nPerhaps if necessary rewards can be given to top burners but that can be extended later. \n\n",

During early stages, OCTO governance tokens shall be used for the following:\n- Participating in voting to settle governance decisions \n- Verifying data tentacles and support systems with staking\n- Interest Program (Octo Yield)\n\nHow to use Snapshot as proposal creator:\n1. Go to https://dao.octo.fi\n2. Click on the button in the right corner \u201cConnect wallet\u201d\n3. Connect with one of the three wallet providers, where you hold $OCTO\n4. Click on the button \u201cNew proposal\u201d at the main page https://snapshot.page/#/octofi\n5. Fill out the field Title:\nOIP-[consecutive number] Title of your Proposal\n6.

Click on \u201cPublish\u201d and create the proposal \n13. Sign the message via your wallet and done\n\nHow to use Snapshot for voting ?\n1. Go to https://dao.octo.fi\n2.
