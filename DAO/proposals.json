    "title": "Vote to engage a Head of Legal & General Counsel for Lido",
    "description": "This is a vote to onboard a DAO-vetted Head of Legal & General Counsel for the Lido DAO based on the two following proposals:\n\n[Candidate Proposal for Head of Legal & General Counsel Role](https://research.lido.fi/t/candidate-proposal-for-head-of-legal-and-general-counsel/2723).\n[Role Overview - Head of Legal & General Counsel Proposal](https://research.lido.fi/t/head-of-legal-and-general-counsel-proposal/2713).\n\nThe value in this role is time, cost, speed, and risk avoidance. What was the legal landscape before is not now. The scope of Lido projects has broadened. The timing and criticality of the evolving legal landscape needs to be managed to avoid legal pitfalls and to establish sound operational strategies going forward. It will help make or break Lido\u2019s long-term success by helping to see around corners from business and legal perspectives.\n\nHaving our own in-house contributor in this role will source all the best resources in the fastest time frame. No learning curve in finding the resources because the lawyer is embedded in operations, and a reduction in the cost of outside counsel. Under the compensation scheme this person will have vested interest in our success.\n\nThus, an in-house legal role is needed for Lido. Rotorless is a highly qualified candidate who we believe would excel in this role.\n\n### Compensation\nThe proposed compensation for Head of Legal and General Counsel has two components:\n1. Cash compensation of $20,833.33 per month, payable in DAI from the Lido DAO or a structure operating within it.\n2. Token options payable in LDO from the Lido DAO or a structure operating within it, to vest over three years. The option calculation is, as follows:\n\n(Annual wage*k)/(120d LDO TWAP), where:\n* \u201ck\u201d - set at 2.5\n* 120-day LDO TWAP is $1.61 at time of this proposal being republished\n\n1/3 LDO will be vested on the 12-month anniversary of continuous service to the Lido DAO; and 1/36 LDO will be vested upon completion of each subsequent month of continuous service to the Lido DAO.\nThe service-based vesting outlined above represents a contingency for each of the described periods; thus, if the individual quits or is terminated before completing the first 12 months of service, they would have earned no LDO. If they quit or terminated during month 13, they would have earned 1/3rd of the total possible LDO but would not have earned the rest of their potential LDO grant. There are no further lockups on fully vested LDO (i.e., once they vest in some # of LDO, they can sell that # of LDO at any time).\n\n### Probation Period\n\nThe probation period is 3 month starting from the date of proposal acceptance.",

    "description": "This vote is looking to pass the S15 budget for Moonshot Collective (MC).\n\nAmount: The total amount requested from the treasury is $248,220, to be paid in GTC.\nThe GTC total will be determined, based on (a) the current market price of GTC at the time this proposal is moved to Tally, and (b) the remaining balance in the MC Multisig (which will determine how much net new funding we require).\n\nTLDR: The newly defined Purpose & Essential Intents (EI) of GitcoinDAO enabled the Moonshot Collective (MC) to focus on initiatives that advanced those EIs in Season 14. This budget request is to fund the MC community (2 lean teams of 1 PM & 2 devs) to be the first to build on the Grants & Passport protocols. We plan to build composable modules that are valuable to those protocols and its design partners. These composable modules were identified as the most valuable through a collaboration w/ the Gitcoin Product Collective (GPC) workstream.\n\nOverall, the impact/value of our work will help ensure the protocols are approachable, drive adoption of the protocols and increase financial sustainability through increasing GTC Utility.\n\nFor more details, please see this post: https://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s15-proposal-integrated-moonshot-collective-budget-request/11214",

    "description": "The FDD workstream is requesting a season 15 budget of $349,500 plus $233,000 in reserves. The total request is for $582,500 minus the rollover of season 14 reserves. \n\nFDD did not spend any of the $220,000 which was budgeted for S14 reserves.This amount was received from Tally at a cost basis of $2.99 and would be $242,810 at today\u2019s GTC price of $3.30. The value of these reserves and the amount requested will be calculated in GTC using the lower of the 20 day moving average or the spot price, whichever is lower at the time this budget is posted to Tally. \n\nTL:DR\n\nIn Season 15, FDD aims to provide the Gitcoin community with the knowledge that matching funds are allocated as optimally as possible within the given set of assumptions and constraints. One focus will be operationally executing the fraud detection & defense needs of the Gitcoin main/Ethereum round & any other community moderated rounds. The second is assisting Gitcoin Product Collective with operational insights, quantitative analysis, and algorithmic/mechanism design research.\nBased on what we learned in Season 14, we will improve our communication during the season to remove confusion regarding FDD priorities, purpose, and alignment with GitcoinDAO.\n\n\nFor more details please see this post: \nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/s15-proposal-integrated-fdd-budget-request/11224",

    "title": "Setting limits on the number of borrowed gotchis allowed per wallet address",
    "description": "Author: eMM#9638\nGotchi ID: 23748\nDiscourse Threads: \nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/from-days-to-blocks-modifying-the-new-renting-safeguards/4274\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/anti-botting-limits-on-rentals/4294\nhttps://dao.aavegotchi.com/t/reform-public-rental-market/4089\n\nUntil recently there have been no limits on the number of gotchis an address can borrow at the same time, either from a whitelist or from the open (non whitelisted) market. \n\nThis was recently changed to a limit of 1 borrowed gotchi on the open market and 1 by default on all whitelists. A whitelist owner can change the number of allowed borrowed gotchis per address using Louper Dev, and soon, through the official UI.\n\nThis change was put in place with no warning as an experiment in anti botting measures. Community members had reported difficulty in securing a gotchi to borrow for channelling, particularly around the 0:00UTC reset time, which has been attributed to bots scraping all the best rental offers before humans get a chance.\n\nThe change has so far seen Gotchigang report an increase in available gotchis to borrow around reset time which is a positive.\n\nOn the negative side, other Gotchigang have reported being unable to fully channel their aaltars due to not being able to rent enough gotchis. This is particularly for borrowers who\u2019ve paid, say, 20ghst for a long term rental and are now stuck with that 1 gotchi and are unable to channel other parcels using other borrowed gotchis. This issue will tend to grow over time as people level up their aaltars and generate more channelling opportunities. The current limit on the open market is a disincentive to levelling up aaltars and purchasing more land for those without enough gotchis who prefer longer term rentals. It could also severely limit the demand for lending out gotchis long term, however it forces people to approach multiple guilds/whitelist owners for spots which is a positive for the social element of the game.\n\nA poll was run in the weekly DAO Hangout by CoderDan with the results suggesting most community members would prefer the allowed number of borrowed gotchis on the open market to reflect the number of parcels a wallet address holds plus 1, so in theory each parcel could be channelled once per day whilst still holding longer term rentals. For single channel rentals this is less of a concern as people can return a gotchi and borrow another as soon as they\u2019ve finished using it. \n\nFurther increasing the borrowing limit up to the number of available channellings per address was suggested by considering aaltar levels as well, but it was deemed too inefficient to be constantly recalculating this number dynamically in the background.\n\nhttps://discord.com/channels/732491344970383370/892307846010658856/1008035273168392243\n\nAs this was an experiment, I propose we revert these changes back now and continue to monitor the impacts so we can be clearer on the severity of the botting issue and be more confident in the effectiveness of this solution, whilst voting to implement the below. \n\nOnce this experimental change is reverted, voting for option 1 in this proposal will set in place the following:\n\n\u2022\tSet a limit on the number of gotchis each address can borrow from the open market equal to the number of parcels in the borrower\u2019s wallet plus 1.\n\n\u2022\tSet a default limit of 1 borrowed gotchi per address for all existing and new whitelists while giving the whitelist creator the ability to change that limit up to any number.\n\nVoting Options:\n1)\tSet the limit on the number of gotchis each address can borrow from the open market equal to the number of parcels in the borrower\u2019s wallet plus 1 \nAND set a default limit of 1 borrowed gotchi per address for all existing and new whitelists while giving whitelist creators the ability to change that limit up to any number.\n\n2) Revert back to the original unlimited system and do nothing further, allowing unlimited numbers of borrowed gotchis per address both on the open market and through whitelists.\n\n3) Revert back and leave the open rental market to allow unlimited gotchis to be borrowed, but set the default to 1 on all whitelists and implement the ability for whitelist creators to change the limit per whitelist.\n\n4) Do not revert back and leave the current limits of 1 in place across whitelists and the open market (WL owners can still increase the number).\n",

    "title": "Withdraw $10MM of GTC to diversify our treasury and increase governance partners",
    "description": "tl;dr: As we get closer to launching our protocol, we want to extend our governance participation to a few new partners by exchanging governance tokens with stable tokens. This will put the governance tokens into the hands of strategic partners who can help us improve our protocol while also diversifying our treasury to ensure we can continue our mission in a larger crypto winter.\n\n## Details\nIn January we discussed and agreed that diversifying our treasury to hedge against large market down turns would be in our best interest as it would also invite strategic partners to participate in our governance future. This vote is to formalize that intent and extend governance rights to those partners who have shown interest and are aligned to our mission.\n\nVoting Yes on this proposal will enable us to withdraw $10MM of GTC to be used for diversification of governing ownership. We will use the same gnosis safe from our past vote to diversify our treasury. The signers on that Multisig are:\n\n- Myself (Kyle)\n- Annika\n- Shreyas Hariharan\n- Kris\n- Simona\n- James / Fire Eyes\n\nThe full terms of the diversification can be found in the governance post and links below. Here is a quick summary:\n- 17.5% discount on 30day price average\n- 1 year lock up with a linear 1 year unlock there after (2 years fully unlocked).\n- We will use Hedgey to help facilitate the trade and lock up.\n\nHere are a few links to read more: \nSnapshot vote for previously passed TD (with gnosis safe details): https://snapshot.org/#/gitcoindao.eth/proposal/0x0eb45cfd31ddd2701af3d74ce38a9e87292fe42a6b40b26812ff9889b07daeb3\n\nTreasury Diversification rationale on the governance forums:\nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/gitcoin-treasury-diversification/9698\n\nUpdate on terms:\nhttps://gov.gitcoin.co/t/treasury-diversification-part-ii-welcoming-strategic-partners/9825/4\n\nA No vote would be to reject the terms or the idea of diversifying. This will likely kill the effort entirely as the terms have already been negotiated and I dont think we have any more room to change them.\n\n",

    "title": "[ARC] Add MaticX to Polygon v3 Market",
    "description": "# Summary\n\nStader proposes addition of MaticX as collateral to Aave v3 Polygon market. Here\u2019s why Matic X will be a strong addition to the Aave v3 Polygon market:\n\n## About Staderlabs\n\nMaticX is built by Staderlabs, a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider with ~900mn $ in assets with 40k+ users staking with us across Terra, Polygon, Fantom and Hedera\n\n## About MaticX\n\na. MaticX is an ERC20 token that represents the user\u2019s staked assets and accrued rewards. Matic X increases in value relative to Matic as staking rewards accrue\nb. MaticX has been audited by top security audit firms Halborn and Immunebytes\n\n## Liquidity for MaticX\n\na. MaticX has high liquidity on Polygon, with ~3.7 mn$ of liquidity for our Matic <> MaticX pool on Quickswap, within days of LP launch. LPs on more DEXs coming in the next couple of weeks\n\n## Benefits to AAVE and Polygon\n\na. With MaticX, Matic holders can participate in both staking and Defi, unlocking new liquidity from staking for Defi, including Aave\nb. Matic holders will be able to promote decentralization of Polygon by staking with multiple high performing validators\nc. We expect staking participation of the community to increase as we launch a solution to stake directly on the Polygon mainnet in the coming fortnight\n\n\n## Proposed parameters for MaticX\n\na. Max LTV has 55%\nb. Liquidation threshold of 60-65%\nc. Liquidation penalty of 10-15%\nBackground about Stader\n\nStaderLabs 2 is a multi-chain staking infrastructure provider. We are live on 4 blockchains including Terra, Polygon, Fantom and Hedera.\n\nWithin a few months of launch, Stader has more than 900 Mn USD of total assets staking on the platform.\n\n~$850 M+ Luna staked\n$65 M+ HBAR staked\nOver 40k+ users staking with Stader smart contracts\n\n## Adding MaticX to Aave v3 Polygon market\n\nMaticX is an ERC20 token that represents a user\u2019s share of the staked Matic assets with Stader. It is a token that increases in price as the staked MATIC accrues staking rewards and these rewards are compounded i.e. MaticX simply becomes more expensive over time relative to MATIC.\n\nSafety and security are paramount for Stader and we do multiple audits of our smart contracts to safeguard user\u2019s funds. MaticX contracts have been audited twice by reputed audit firms Halborn and Immunebytes. Here are the links to the two Audit Reports: Report 1 & Report 2.\n\nYou can explore Stader\u2019s Liquid Staking for Polygon by going over to the Stader Dapp: https://polygon.staderlabs.com/liquid-staking/maticx 1\n\nMaticX is available on Polygonscan at the address: `0xfa68fb4628dff1028cfec22b4162fccd0d45efb6`\n\n## MaticX Liquidity Pools\n\nThe MaticX <> Matic LP is live on Quickswap\nLP size ~3.7 Mn USD (within a few days)\n\nExpect to significantly increase with dual rewards available for the pool. We are launching staking on the Polygon Mainnet in a few days and this will amplify the MaticX TVL and the LP size manifold (Polygon\u2019s staking protocol is native to Ethereum, so Stader Polygon v1 only supports staking Matic on Ethereum.)\n\nWe will also be creating LPs, and incentivising them across other Polygon DEXs\n\n## Benefits to Polygon & Aave Community\n\nWe believe MaticX will be a great addition to Aave v3 Polygon markets as it will unlock several borrowing use cases including leveraged staking, borrowing other assets with MaticX and potentially several DeGen strategies.\n\nStader\u2019s selection of validators is transparent (here 2) and centered around generating highest staking returns for delegators and encouraging decentralization of Polygon.\n\nHigh performing validators (100% of last 200 checkpoints, >98% checkpoints in last 90 days)\nCommissions (<=5%)\nPreference to lower voting power\n\nWe expect MaticX to continue to grow in demand as we integrate across more ecosystem partners and also increase overall staking participation in Polygon (currently only 14,000 wallets of total of 140m active wallets stake on Polygon). Aave would be one of the first protocols to offer significant lending offerings for MaticX driving a lot of Matic community to Aave.\n\n## Parameters\n\nBased on the updated WMATIC risk parameters, we propose the following risk parameters for MaticX as MaticX is backed by Matic staked via Stader\u2019s contract.\n\nMax LTV of 55% for MaticX (compared to 65% for WMATIC)\nLiquidation threshold of 60-65% for MaticX (compared to 70% for WMATIC)\nLiquidation penalty of 10-15% for MaticX (compared to 10% for WMATIC)\nWe would like to hear feedback and update any specific information/ parameters as suggested by the Polygon and Aave community.\n\n## Update (July 1, 2022)\n\nAdding a small section to update on all the developments from the time of original proposal being published.\n\nTraction: More than 13 million Matic by 1.4k+ unique wallets already staked with Stader for MaticX. We launched the ability for Polygon community to stake directly on Polygon in early May without having to bridge to Ethereum enabling cheaper, faster transactions and have seen strong adoption\n\nLiquidity: We have ~10 mn $ in liquidity across DEXs, with a ~5.4 mn $ on Balancer metastable pool (suited for low slippage) On Polygon, currently in Top 2 pools by liquidity size on Balancer Polygon\n\nChainlink price feed: Our calculated price feed for MaticX from Chainlink is in testing phase and expected to be live in the week starting July 11\n\nDefi and Lending: On lending, we have ~1 mn $ of MaticX already being lent on Polygon Defi (primarily on Meshswap single sided lending). We have also forged strong partnerships across Polygon Defi, including\na) Balancer Labs, Quickswap, Meshswap in DEXs,\nb) Beefy Finance, Autofarm, Harvest Finance in yield optimizers, Meshswap and\nc) Meshswap, Market XYZ in lending\nMaticX can be redeemed for the underlying Matic with an unbonding period of ~3 days (80 checkpoints as per Polygon native staking contract) mitigating depeg risks\nLook forward to bringing MaticX to the AAVE and Polygon communities.\n\nNote: Stader\u2019s overall now stands around 50 mn $ compared to the 900 mn $ at the time of original proposal due to the unfortunate Terra crash, where a large % of our TVL was.\n\n# Risk Assessment\n[Risk Assessment](https://governance.aave.com/t/proposal-to-add-maticx-to-aave-v3-polygon-market/7995/9) details can be found on the Governance Forum.  \n\n![Image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/f/f3515a8f4736917930582fd5e4430d52608e6686.png)\n\n![Image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/b/bc6c1c6042eb85df738d20e516ba52f6be16d5ce.png)\n    \nAs with stETH and sAVAX, this proposal recommends listing maticX with borrowing disabled.\n\nComments\n\nHaving recently obtained a Chainlink oracle, maticX can be listed on Aave v3 on Polygon. maticX can be added as collateral in Isolation Mode with a Supply Cap in place. A Supply Cap of around $6M is suggested which represents half the market capitalisation of maticX on Polygon and also approximately the value of a trade with 5% price impact via 1inch\u2019s aggregator at the time of writing. The Supply Cap should be revised to prevailing liquidity conditions.\n\nThe initial listing risks parameters for maticX are the same as those proposed for stMATIC with a revised lower supply cap reflecting the lower liquidity profile.\n\nGiven users may recursively strategy of depositing maticX, borrowing matic, swapping/staking it for maticX and then depositing maticX into Aave\u2019s lending pool again, an E-Mode should be created between maticX and MATIC. The Supply Cap is intended to ensure there sufficient maticX liquidity remains across decentralised exchanges, as the strategy has the effect of transferring liquidity from exchange liquidity pools into lending pools. With a calculated oracle, the risk of being liquidated is lower and therefore it is expected the leverage strategies will be more aggressively pursued than the stETH strategy on Aave v2 on Ethereum.\n\nThe following Isolation and Efficiency Mode parameters would be a good starting place based upon current market conditions:\n\n## Isolation & Efficiency-Mode Parameters\n \n![Image](https://aws1.discourse-cdn.com/standard21/uploads/aave/original/2X/3/33a87fd3a23385e82bf2b351a59a2ed151ef676e.png)\n \nThe Efficiency Mode (eMode) parameters are a balance of used for other applications like sAVAX listing on the Avalanche market and for Stablecoins on Polygon.",

    "description": "PIP20: Community Project Incubation: \nSoulbound Protocol -- permissionless platform for non-transferable NFTs providing public goods, user experience, and privacy\n\nIncubation Proposal\nAuthor: Diyway#5702 and 0xAA#2040\nReviewer: Incubation Committee\nRequired Quorum: 100M (if votes don't exceed Quorum, then proposal will need more than 90% approval to pass)\nVote Duration: 5 days\n\nSoulbound Protocol is an NFT platform providing non-transferable NFTs that commemorate or represent a specific experience, event, or affiliation. This project is led by 0xAA, a core contributor skilled in smart contracts, and David, a PhD from Oxford with experience in blockchain technology, marketing, and computer engineering. \n\nVitalik Buterin articulated the use cases and benefits of non-transferable NFTs, called Soulbound Tokens (SBTs), in a January blog post. Aligned with this vision, Soulbound Protocol provides projects and users the ability to mint non-transferable NFTs for the following applications:\n- Soulbound proof of attendance NFTs\n- On-chain certificates\n- Sybil resistant airdrops (\u201cSoulDrop\u201d) \n- Governance (\u201cSoul Gov\u201d)\n\nThis project has an early-mover advantage and is among the first platforms putting SBTs into practice. The website is up and running as a demo product, giving Soulbound Protocol a head start on potential competitors: https://soulbound.life \n\nSoulbound Protocol requests funding in the amount of 200,000 $PEOPLE to help with product development and marketing. \n\nFunding will support development of a Plugin system for the distribution of Soulbound's Token Standard, ERC721S, and enable preparation for the Q3 2022 Mainnet launch.\n\nCold start funding will help the Soulbound team acquire the necessary hires to keep the team's progress on target with their goals for Q3 and Q4 of 2022.\n\n2022 Q3\n- Mainnet Launch\n- Plugin system for ERC721S distribution\n\n2022 Q4\n- Verification System \n- SoulDrop\n\nIn return for funding, this project offers membership NFTs to PeopleDAO and its subDAOs. Soulbound also commits to swapping at least 5% of its treasury to $PEOPLE.\n\nSoulbound offers further ROI in the form of providing PeopleDAO 2% of its governance token and 5% of funding raised (capped at 50 ETH). Lastly, Soulbound will allocate a small proportion of its governance token to individuals within PeopleDAO who contributed to Soulbound Protocol.\n\nThe detailed proposal can be found here:\nhttps://docs.google.com/document/d/1AaARUeqWSAwI9IhhzY8FQuTJGUbtnuPOnWdB3BeLXag/\n",

Sometimes I see ultra rare Squad sold on really slow price, like they were common ones.\nIt would be nice to see some ranking list of the Squad based on rarity, and for example, the more rare the Squad is, the more cake in the IFO you can commit.\nWe could maybe implement some pool/farm bonus to the Squad owner which gives the bonus based on rarity.\n\nI don't know, these are some utilities that came to my mind, but actually anything else would be super. What do you think?\n",

    "description": "I propose to increase the APR of staking and liquidity providing to reward the active users of Pancakeswap.\n\nWith low APRs (and getting lower due to votes) we are not incentivising people to use Pancakeswap directly, if CAKE has little to no emmisions at all why use Pancakeswap? Just hold your CAKE in an exchange, much easier.\n\nI don't think people fully understand the effect of emissions, think of emissions as a company giving stock dividends instead of cash, let's say 4% stock dividend, nothing happens at all, because everybody gets 4% (This is not the case for Pancakeswap since we have burns).\n\nHowever not all CAKE holders get the best returns. Let's go back to the dividend example, some people get the 4%, some don't, in this scenario the 4% return guy actually gets something because he gets more compared to others. This is a good way to reward people who actually use Pancakeswap.\n\nIf CAKE emmisions go to zero, there will be no more staking and rewards for providing liquidity is very low. What do you think will happen to Pancakeswap if that occurs?\n\nHere's another one, people just get excited over high APRs even if it's pure inflation. (to reiterate CAKE is not purely inflationary due to burns).\n\nFrom what I see most people want CAKE to be deflationary, which is great, but not the best option. If what you want is to get the maximum amount of value, increasing emissions is the best option. If you're reading this you're one of the people going to benefit from higher emissions. \n\nI'm not proposing to increase the emissions to max immediately, there are people who want the exact opposite of what I'm proposing after all. \n\nDeflation can still be achieved, what we need to do is focus on deflationary products, instead of trying to force it through lower emissions.\n\nWe get more burns if more people use the platform, increasing emissions will get us more users.\n\nThank you for reading, let's continue to make this a great community.",

    "title": "Allow us to setup Limit Orders & Trading Grid Bots (will burn more cake and higher apy) ",
    "description": "It would be nice to introduce trading bots which would require limit orders to work. With trading bots it will greatly increase the volume and the burn rate of cake. (from fees).\n\n\nExample of trading bot setup\nParameter 5-20\n100 orders\n\nSo if cake hits 5 you will have 100% cake and if cake hits 20 your will have 100% stables. In between 5 to 20 there would be 100 sell/buy orders. So imagine the account of trading fees and lp rewards being generated. This would mean more cake will be burnt and more rewards will be given. In my opinion the lp rewards will be much more higher than now. \n\n",

As for pancakeswap it would be like setting a deadline to have 0 emissions or below before we hit the max supply. \n\nHere is the plan:\nMaximum supply will be set at 500m which would take over 2 years for it to hit. Pancakeswap will do everything within 2 years to bring emissions down to 0 or negative to prevent it hitting 500m.\n\nIf pancakeswap fails to achieve it then once we hit 500m cake all new minting will be paused and rewards will be given out from NFT fees, IFO, transaction fees etc....  Please note by then we may have even features that would burn cake like gamification, margin, lending and borrowing. \n\n\n\n",

If you choose to sell/buy the token there will be a 5% tax so keeping/farming your own is encouraged. \n\nBenefitting Cake\n1. Less people will be staking in normal pools/farms = higher APY\n2. A new cake nft token can give you another source of income that could be better than current farms. \n3. Cake will have higher demand\n\nNote: figures can be changed, but its just an example of a system that i think will benefit cake. ",

    "description": "Hey Octonauts,\n\nIf we reach that stage of OctoFi and you are reading this, then we are already doing great.\nOpenness and transparency are central to OctoFi\u2019s mission in the delivery of decentralized finance (oracles) tentacles. \nThe primary use-case afforded by project supporters will be the foundational governance decisions. During early stages, OCTO governance tokens shall be used for the following:\n- Participating in voting to settle governance decisions \n- Verifying data tentacles and support systems with staking\n- Interest Program (Octo Yield)\n\nHow to use Snapshot as proposal creator:\n1. Go to https://dao.octo.fi\n2. Click on the button in the right corner \u201cConnect wallet\u201d\n3. Connect with one of the three wallet providers, where you hold $OCTO\n4. Click on the button \u201cNew proposal\u201d at the main page https://snapshot.page/#/octofi\n5. Fill out the field Title:\nOIP-[consecutive number] Title of your Proposal\n6. Fill out the biggest field and tell the community about your idea or question, go into every detail. Don't forget plans about how to execute the idea or question, and funding, if needed.\n7. Place the voting options \n8. Now go to the \u201cActions\u201d box \n9. Select the start date \n10. Select the end date (Remember to give enough time for voting)\n11. Fill out the Snapshot block number (now it's getting a bit crazy, read more about that number in the next section)\n\nSnapshot block number:\nThis number is important to lock the state of community members who are able to vote.\nMeans if you come around a nice proposal and the block number is in the past and you don't own any $OCTO yet or before the block number, you can't vote.\n\nH = h + ((t1 \u2014 t0) / a) \n\nWhere:\nH = target block height\nh = current block height\nt0 = current timestamp (in seconds)\nt1 = target timestamp (in seconds)\na = average time to solve a block (in seconds)\nEasy right ?\nOr \nlast_block_number + ((future_time - time_now) / block_time)\n\nSo, for example, using a current epoch time (https://www.epochconverter.com) of 1481214124, the epoch time of 1482537600 for midnight Christmas Eve, and the last block of 2771338:\n2771338 + ((1482537600 - 1481214124) / 14) = 2865872\n\nOr just look at https://etherscan.io/blocks and use the last block number ;-)\n\n12. Click on \u201cPublish\u201d and create the proposal \n13. Sign the message via your wallet and done\n\nHow to use Snapshot for voting ?\n1. Go to https://dao.octo.fi\n2.
